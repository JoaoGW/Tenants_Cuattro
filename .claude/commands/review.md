# Review Workflow

Review `$ARGUMENTS`. If no scope is provided, review the current working-tree diff.

## Process

1. Identify the reviewed scope and inspect the relevant diff, callers, contracts, and tests.
2. Use the `code-reviewer` subagent when the scope is large enough to benefit from isolated analysis.
3. Check correctness, regressions, API compatibility, security implications, and test coverage.
4. Do not edit files, create comments, create issues, commit, push, or update external services.
5. Do not report subjective style preferences as defects.

## Output Contract

Return findings only when they are concrete and actionable:

- `[P0]` Blocks release, causes data loss, security exposure, or critical failure.
- `[P1]` Causes incorrect behavior, regression, or meaningful contract break.
- `[P2]` Is a contained quality, maintainability, or test-gap concern.

For every finding provide:

- file and line;
- evidence from the code;
- concrete impact;
- smallest recommended correction.

If no findings are identified, say: `No actionable findings found.`
